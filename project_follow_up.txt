1) Build sodoku game
In this section we have build sodoku game and the things which are required for our game are as follows
- first you have to build the UI for the game
- then after this you have to do the logic of the game 
 and in this case the things which we are going to do are as follows
 the values of the board are randomly generated which means when the user clicks the button new game/ restart the values which are setted are given randomly 
 and this makes the board to be random rather than of doing the same thing again and again
 
 And for this case I have defined functions 
    - which generates random board
    - based on this random board there are some functions which are used this are shuffle function, solve and also possible functions 
	this functions have been developed for the purpose of making the game to be efficient and for the algorithm part I have some form of back-tracking 
	which is under the solve and also the possible functions.


Back to the UI
1) We have to specify where does we use the usestate and also the useeffect react hooks 

USESTATE: in this case all of the cells in the board have state which is listed as follows
	: "." this is so as to specify the values in this case is empty and the user has chance to fill out
	: num values these are the values in which the user has no control over them and they used as the main point of the game
	:
